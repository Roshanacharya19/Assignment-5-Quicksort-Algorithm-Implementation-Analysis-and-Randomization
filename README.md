# Quicksort Algorithm Implementation and Analysis

This repository contains implementations and analysis of deterministic and randomized Quicksort algorithms.

## Files
- `quicksort_analysis.py`: Main implementation and analysis code
- `README.md`: This file

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Running the Code
1. Install requirements: `pip install matplotlib numpy`
2. Run the script: `python quicksort_analysis.py`

## Results Summary
- Implemented both deterministic and randomized Quicksort
- Verified theoretical complexities through empirical testing
- Randomized version avoids worst-case O(nÂ²) performance
- Complete analysis available in the report
